# DigitalSquashLocking
A digital implementation of the squash locking method. Used to frequency stabilize an injected diode laser.
DigitalSquashLocking.py is the main script. Sr2CameraSetup.py contains a class that is used by the main script.
Note that the script also uses a class from redpitaya_scpi.py. However this script was not done by me. So you will have to find it from their own site or use a different method to output a voltage signal.
